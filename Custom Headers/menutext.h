" Snake game is the game of snake having adventures, in a location that exists on a flat torus universe.\n"
" That means opposite sides of the map are connected, and when anything exits from one side, it enters from opposite side.\n"
" Snake can move in any four directions. Snake cannot eat itself, because it dies from its own venom \n"

" Though snake produces its own venom, ingesting it causes nothing, beause it is not poisonous.\n"
" If snake doesn't eat for long time, it start to lose unnecessary body parts to save energy, starting from tail.\n"
" If snakes loses all its body parts, it dies, and the game is over.\n\n"

" In campaign mode, snake has to eat required number of foods, and gain enough energy to open portal to new map.\n"
" Once all maps are completed, game concludes.\n\n"
